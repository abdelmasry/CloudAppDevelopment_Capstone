### Solution architecture

* The solution will consist of multiple technologies

* The user interacts with the Django application through a web browser.
* The Django application handles the user authentication using the SQLite database as the persistance layer.
* The SQLite database also stores the Car Make and the Car Model data.
* The dealerships and the reviews are stored in Cloudant, a NoSQL document based database.
* IBM Cloud functions are used to interface with the Cloudant database to get dealerships, get reviews and post reviews.
* The Django application talks to the IBM Cloud Functions via a set or proxy services.
